```{r}
##  Read activity.csv file if it exists
if (file.exists("activity.csv")) {
        Activity_df <- read.csv("activity.csv")
        }
##  Determine the total number of steps taken each day.
Steps_per_day <- tapply(Activity_df$steps, Activity_df$date, sum)
##  Convert results into a data frame
Steps_per_day_df <- data.frame(Steps_per_day)
##  Make a histogram of results using ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
qplot(Steps_per_day_df$Steps_per_day, geom="histogram")
##  Calculate mean and median steps per day (ignoring missing data)
  mean_steps <- mean(Steps_per_day_df$Steps_per_day, na.rm = TRUE)
  median_steps <- median(Steps_per_day_df$Steps_per_day, na.rm = TRUE)
##  Report mean and median values
  mean_steps
  median_steps
